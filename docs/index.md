# Browser Adventure

You've heard of MMORPGs, well this is a SSORPG. It's a small, single-player, online role-playing game.
Maybe in the future it might even become Massive.

That's the dream with this webapp. Making it easy for people to play tabletop games without needing a human dungeon master.
With this software we're prioritizing:
 - Enabling solo ttrpg players a better experience*
 - Making it easy for writers to add content
 - Create open standard formats for exchanging RPG content. We all thrive together when we work together

* For prewritten content. As much as I'd love to enable freeform adventuring, it's incredibly technically complex.
