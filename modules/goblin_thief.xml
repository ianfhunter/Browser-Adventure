                    You walk through a street at night which is deserted apart from a creature the size of a child, which crosses your path, runs away and disappears in a cellar beneath a worn down building.

                Three drunk pirates, equipped with sables and knives,
                two are asleep on a bed frame and the floor. The only one awake is singing sadly: 
                "♫ Oh my poor darling Greta, taken away ♫ Toss'd oversea to avoid more decay ♫ My poor pretty lass with her green emerald eyes..  ♫"

                This miserable scene is lit by a small lantern, standing on the floor

                in the room you can hardly enter it.

               The door to this room is locked. There are two
                small beds inside. The goblin thief is hiding
                beneath one of the beds. When discovered he will
                try to defend himself with a kitchen knife or
                negotiate. Around this time, two goblins carrying
                a spear and a bow return home from the street.
