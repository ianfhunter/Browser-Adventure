            Welcome to the town of <lore>Buudershaw</lore>, a small farming town on the southern outskirts of the <lore>Riddean Empire</lore>. It\'s been a long boresome journey, but you have made it here in one piece. Your burly dwarven driver helps you out of the hay and onto the dirt roads.

            Well, we should get you ready to start adventuring! I have given you 100 gold to buy equipment at the market. You can head over to the Market Square by clicking on location (1) of the Town Map.

                The town street appears to be deserted. It appears the traders have returned home for the day. You wander through the maze of vacant stalls, but after an exhaustive search - there is still noone around.

                "Nyeh-heh!" a voice cackles as you feel a hand at your waist cut loose your coinpurse. The creature flees down the cobblestones as fast as their little feet can carry them. You race after them, but you lose them as they twist and turn through the alleyways

                Three drunk pirates, equipped with sables and knives, two are asleep on a bed frame and the floor. The only one awake is singing a sad dwarvish dirge. This miserable scene is lit by a small lantern, standing on the floor

               The door to this room is locked. There are two small beds inside. The goblin thief is hiding beneath one of the beds. When discovered he will try to defend himself with a kitchen knife or negotiate. Around this time, two goblins carrying a spear and a bow return home from the street. (TODO)
